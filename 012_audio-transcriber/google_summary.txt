At the Smithsonian, David Curley marks 50 years since Apollo 11's moon landing, showcasing original ABC News coverage. Training for the mission involved the Lunar Landing Training Vehicle (LLTV), crucial for Neil Armstrong. Armstrong famously survived a near-fatal crash in an LLTV in 1968, ejecting safely. Following design modifications for improved safety and stability, Armstrong completed several successful flights in the "flying bedstead" just before Apollo 11. He praised the LLTV for accurately simulating the unique handling characteristics of the lunar module during landing, calling it a very worthwhile training tool.
