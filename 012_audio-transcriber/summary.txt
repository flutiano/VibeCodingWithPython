The Smithsonian Air and Space Museum commemorates 50 years since Apollo 11's moon landing, focusing on the Lunar Landing Training Vehicle (LLTV). Neil Armstrong famously used the LLTV, designed to simulate lunar gravity, for training. He survived a near-fatal crash in 1968, ejecting due to fuel pressure loss and a faulty warning light, demonstrating his critical composure. Following safety modifications, which improved stability despite altering gravity simulation, Armstrong successfully completed further LLTV flights, praising its effective simulation of the lunar module's unique landing characteristics just before the historic mission.
